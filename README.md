# Weather-Application
This project involves designing and developing a weather application that uses temperature, humidity, and pressure data retrieved from a Web API via the libcurl library. The solution is structured into three main subsections:

1. Data Retrieval: This section is responsible for fetching data from the Web API. By utilizing the libcurl library, the application retrieves up-to-date weather information including temperature, humidity, and pressure.

2. Data Processing: In this subsection, the retrieved data is processed and formatted. This involves filtering, organizing, and preparing the data to ensure it is accurate and ready for visualization.

3. Data Visualization: The final subsection focuses on presenting the processed data in a user-friendly manner. The weather information is visualized to provide clear and useful insights to the user, making it easy to understand the current weather conditions.

By dividing the application into these distinct subsections, the project ensures a clear and efficient workflow from data retrieval to visualization.
